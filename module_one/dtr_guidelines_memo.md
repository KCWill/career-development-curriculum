# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template to when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.* 

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
	We would like to learn to work as a team on a single project. We're feeling pretty comfortable with the content of the project, so we would like to practice the "soft skills" of pair programming.
	
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
	We enjoy working in a 'divide-and-conquer' approach, but we see the value in a good pair programming experience. 
	
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
	Open communication is really important to us. We like to be held accountable and shouldn't be afraid to ask for help when we need it. Ruby has a strict cutoff of 8pm to cease all communication and Kyle agreed. 
	
* How would you describe your work style?
	We're both work best alone, but we both recognize that we would like to change that. We're going to keep a schedule and we'll consistently work to stick to it. 
	
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
	Both of us feel very comfortable with JavaScript and functions especially. Ruby knows a lot about flexboxes while Kyle has never learned them. We both know how to Google and apply concepts through trial and error. 
	
* Whatâ€™s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
	The projects have gone relatively well so far. Some procrastination has come from Kyle, so it will be important to keep to a schedule. 
	
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
	We will use the GitHub Projects Kanban functionality. We can add issues that we are seeing and address them quickly. We can talk about any disagreements we might have. Be open to criticism and not to sweat the small stuff (as much, since we both tend to do that). 
	
* How will we overcome obstacles?
	After Googling, asking eachother, we can ask others for help. If we run into a personality conflict we can talk it out with a project manager. 
	
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
	We both work well in different environments. We work best when we're at Turing with less distractions. Ruby requested that we do not do coding after 8pm and Kyle's agreed. 
	
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
	Ruby: 8pm, no coding on Sunday nights.
	Kyle: Not staying at Turing past 8. Rarely come in on weekends. 
	
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
	We're usually pretty open to feedback. If the problem is extremely aggregious that would take a lot of time to fix, we might just have put our heads down and work. We both need to work on giving specific feedback that paves a path to a better product. 
	
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
	Ruby: JavaScript (functions), HTML, Flexboxes, CSS 
	Kyle: JavaScript  (functions), HTML, CSS 
	Kyle needs to learn about flexboxes. Our biggest concern is sticking to a schedule and improving our group-work compatibility. 
	
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
	GitHub Projects and Slack
	
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
	1. Google. 2. Ask partner. 3. Ask other students at Turing. 4. Ask project manager. 
	
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
	We both understand every line of code in a project. We could redo the project individually very quickly since we understand all aspects of the project. 
	
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
	We're going to make sure to keep to a schedule as much as possible. We'll exchange words of encouragement along the way!

### Template for DTR Memo

Project: Intention Timer

Group Member Names: Ruby Rinken and Kyle Williams 

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?): Kyle would like to learn about flexboxes and the use of GitHub branches. Ruby would like to learn how to build something with a partner.
	
Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
	Ruby and Kyle have similar Pairin qualities. We both are calm and inquirous. We both are relatively quiet and collected when working, so we both will (hopefully) get alone splendidly. 

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:
	We are both very good at problem solving, so we can use our resources (google, other groups, etc.) to get our work done. 

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?): We will work after school until 6 at the latest. We will not work past 8pm and not on Sundays. 

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?): We will talk every day and communicate through Slack and our GitHub Project page. 

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement): We both would like to improve our pair-programming skills. We feel very comfortable with the technical areas of this project, so we're going to focus on collaboration. 

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?): 

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques): 

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
